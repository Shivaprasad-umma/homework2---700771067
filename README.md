Q7. Decision Tree with Different Depths ---> Trains decision trees on the Iris dataset with varying max_depth.Compares training and test accuracy to show underfitting vs. overfitting.Highlights the importance of tuning depth for balanced performance. Q8. kNN with Different k Values & Decision Boundaries ---> Uses kNN on Iris dataset with only two features for visualization.Plots decision boundaries for different k values.Shows bias-variance tradeoff: small k = flexible, large k = smoother. Q9. kNN Evaluation ---> Evaluates kNN using confusion matrix and classification report.Analyzes precision, recall, and F1-score across classes.Plots ROC curves with One-vs-Rest to assess class separability.
